I want to delete using INNER JOIN in SQL Server 2008.

But I get this error:

Msg 156, Level 15, State 1, Line 15
Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'INNER'.

My code:

DELETE FROM WorkRecord2 
INNER JOIN Employee ON EmployeeRun=EmployeeNo
WHERE Company = '1' AND Date = '2013-05-06'



DELETE w
FROM WorkRecord2 w
INNER JOIN Employee e
  ON EmployeeRun=EmployeeNo
WHERE Company = '1' AND Date = '2013-05-06'

Or try this -

 DELETE WorkRecord2 
      FROM WorkRecord2 
INNER JOIN Employee 
        ON EmployeeRun=EmployeeNo
     WHERE Company = '1' 
       AND Date = '2013-05-06';

Or try this -
      
DELETE FROM dbo.WorkRecord2 
WHERE EmployeeRun IN (
    SELECT e.EmployeeNo
    FROM dbo.Employee e
    WHERE ...
)

Or try this -

DELETE FROM dbo.WorkRecord2 
WHERE EXISTS(
    SELECT 1
    FROM dbo.Employee e
    WHERE EmployeeRun = e.EmployeeNo
        AND ....
)
